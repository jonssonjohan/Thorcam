# Thorcam
My adaptation of a camera handler for a Thorlabs scientific camera. The handler is a object which makes it more modular and it it also thread based. Two images are collected and put into a queue. The queue can be shared with another thread which fetch and display and/or save the images. Make sure the native dlls are visible in the folder so `path_setup` can find them. The code is based on SDK's from Thorlabs
